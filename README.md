This is the official GitHub repo for the Rate My Internship webapp. Rate My Internship is currently an ongoing portfolio project
that is being developed by a small team of college students comprised of Ben Kosa, Qiubei Li, Sophia Wei, David Leung, Sacchit Mittal, Nancy Wu, and Jennifer Cao. 

The main purpose of the site is to help college students who want to find out more about an internship through reviews made by real interns. This website has two main functions: people can use it to either
 1. write and post a review of any internships they attended
 2. search for a company, internship, or intern posiiton and browse any and all reviews made by real interns.
